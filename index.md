## Break a leg, not your toe

Over 50% of injuries reported by preprofessional ballet dancers occur in the ankle or toes. Many of these injuries are attributed to the stress put on the body by wearing pointe shoes. When dancing on pointe, it is critical for dancers to stay completely over the box of the pointe shoe. Balancing while leaning to either side or not completely getting over the box of the shoe will cause the shoe to irregularly break down which makes it impossible to maintain proper technique. The dance community needs technology where they can monitor the force distribution while a dancer performs combinations on pointe. This could be achieved by using a large pressure sensor mat large and sturdy enough where ballet dancers could perform sections of choreography and combinations.
